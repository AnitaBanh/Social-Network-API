  Run 'npm start' to start local server. Then run API routes in Insomnia. 
  
  The initial database is empty, so start by creating users and then posting thoughts and reactions to those thougthts. The API also has the functionality to view all users, view a single user, add friends to users, view all thoughts, view a single thought, update users and thoughts, as well as delete users, delete thoughts and delete reactions. Once a user is deleted, that user's associated thoughts are also deleted.
